If you found this book useful for your blog post, research article or product, I would be grateful if you would cite this book.
You can cite the book like this:


```
Molnar, C. (2022). Interpretable Machine Learning:
A Guide for Making Black Box Models Explainable (2nd ed.).

```

Or use the following bibtex entry:

```
@book{molnar2022,
  title      = {Interpretable Machine Learning},
  author     = {Christoph Molnar},
  year       = {2022},
  subtitle   = {A Guide for Making Black Box Models Explainable},
  edition    = {2},
  url        = {https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book}
}
```

I am always curious about where and how interpretation methods are used in industry and research.
If you use the book as a reference, it would be great if you wrote me a line and told me what for.
This is of course optional and only serves to satisfy my own curiosity and to stimulate interesting exchanges.
