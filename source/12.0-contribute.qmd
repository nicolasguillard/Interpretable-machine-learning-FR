# Contribute to the Book {#contribute}

Thank you for reading my book about Interpretable Machine Learning.
The book is under continuous development.
It will be improved over time and more chapters will be added.
Very similar to how software is developed.

All text and code for the book is open source and [available at github.com](https://github.com/christophM/interpretable-ml-book).
On the GitHub page you can suggest fixes and [open issues](https://github.com/christophM/interpretable-ml-book/issues) if you find a mistake or if something is missing.
